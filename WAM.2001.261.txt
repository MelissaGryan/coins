This coin has remarkably high relief and is extremely well preserved,
maintaining amazing detail. Interestingly, only the border is worn
away and only from 6:00-8:00 and again from 11:00-12:00 on the obverse
and from 12:00-1:00 and slighter wear from 4:00-7:00 on the reverse.
There is also a chink or crack on the edge of the coin around 11:00
relative to the obverse.
