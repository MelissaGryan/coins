This denarius depicting Plautilla is in good condition. The obverse is in high relief
and the legend is still easily legible. The edges of the flan are irregular and have several
light, seemingly unintentional striations.The top of the obverse border is slightly off-flan
from 10:30 to 11:30 and from 12:30 to 1:30.

The reverse is also in good condition and highly legible. The bottom of the border, from 5 o'clock
to 8 o'clock is off-flan.
