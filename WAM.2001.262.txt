This coin was very difficult to identify because of the wear,
particularly on the reverse where almost the entire reverse
legend is not visible besides “S C”. I was torn between ric.4.ss.869
and ric.4.ss.894_as on OCRE which both have identical descriptions 
and neither of which have pictures. However, I decided upon the latter
(ic.4.ss.894_as) because the coin’s weight and size seemed more fitting
for an as rather than a sestertius.
