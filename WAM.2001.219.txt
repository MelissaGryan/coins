This denarius of Ivlia Mamaea has the types in high relief. The legends on both obverse and reverse
appear blurred but are still legible in the photography. The overall condition is fair. It is unclear whether
this blurred effect is a because of the state of the physical artifact or the photography.
The border of the obverse is off-flan from 5 to 7. The border of the reverse is off-flan from 4 to 6:30
